# Checksum Wizard Documentation

## Overview
**Checksum Wizard** is a Python script designed for computing and verifying checksum values for files. The script supports various hashing algorithms and can either generate checksum values for a file or validate a file against a provided checksum. It handles errors gracefully and provides clear feedback on operations.


## Features
- **Checksum Computation**: Computes checksum values for a given file using multiple hashing algorithms.
- **Checksum Validation**: Validates a file's checksum against a provided checksum value.
- **Error Handling**: Includes custom error handling for file access and checksum computation errors.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Operates via command-line arguments for flexible usage.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: The script is written for Python 3.x.
- **`hashlib`**: Provides various hashing algorithms like `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, etc., used for computing checksum values.
- **`sys`**: Handles command-line arguments and system-specific parameters, including script exit codes.

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script from the command line with appropriate arguments:

   ```bash
   python sample.py <generate|validate> <file_path> [<checksum>]
   ```

   - `<generate|validate>`: Specify whether you want to generate checksums or validate a checksum.
   - `<file_path>`: Path to the file for which to compute or validate the checksum.
   - `[<checksum>]`: (Optional) Checksum value for validation (used only in 'validate' mode).

2. **Commands**
   - **Generate Checksums**: To compute checksums for a file, use:
     ```
     python sample.py generate path/to/your/file
     ```
   - **Validate Checksum**: To validate a checksum, use:
     ```
     python sample.py validate path/to/your/file <checksum_value>
     ```

## Conclusion
The **Checksum Wizard** script provides an efficient solution for computing and verifying file checksums using various hashing algorithms. Designed to handle both checksum generation and validation, it offers clear feedback and robust error handling through a command-line interface. While it serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding file integrity and checksum processes, it is intended for learning purposes and should not be used for industrial or commercial applications.
